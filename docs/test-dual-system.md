# Dual Role System Test Plan

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

The dual role system for admin and organization shared pages has been successfully implemented with the following architecture:

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components

1. **Dual Role Helper** (`src/lib/dual-role-helper.ts`)
   - Server-side context determination
   - System admin vs organization member detection
   - Permission validation for resources

2. **Data Access Layer** (`src/lib/data-access-layer.ts`) 
   - Unified data fetching with automatic permission filtering
   - Admin can access all data, org members limited to their organization
   - Role-appropriate API method selection

3. **Shared Data Hooks** (`src/hooks/use-shared-data.ts`)
   - React Query hooks for consistent client-side data management
   - Automatic API route selection based on user permissions
   - Query key management for proper caching

4. **Shared Components**
   - `SharedUserList` - Shows users with role-appropriate actions
   - `SharedOrganizationList` - Shows organizations with context-aware permissions

5. **API Routes**
   - `/api/shared/users` - User listing with organization filtering  
   - `/api/shared/users/[userId]` - User details with access control
   - `/api/shared/organizations` - Organization listing
   - `/api/shared/user-context` - Current user permission context
   - `/api/shared/invite-user` - User invitations
   - `/api/shared/update-user-role` - Role management

6. **Page Routes**
   - `/dashboard/users` - Shared user management page
   - `/dashboard/organizations` - Shared organization management page
   - Both adapt UI based on user role (admin vs organization member)

### üîë Key Features

- **Role-Based UI**: Same components show different actions based on user permissions
- **Data Isolation**: Organization members only see their org data, admins see all
- **Better Auth Integration**: Uses proper server-side (auth.api) and client-side (authClient) patterns  
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support throughout the stack
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Consistent UX**: Toast notifications and loading states

### üéØ User Experience

**System Admin Experience:**
- Can view all users across all organizations
- Can filter users by specific organization
- Has system-level actions (ban users, manage system roles)
- Sees "System Admin" badge throughout the interface
- Can switch between viewing all users vs organization-specific users

**Organization Member Experience:**  
- Only sees users within their active organization
- Has organization-level actions (invite users, manage org roles)
- Cannot access system-wide data
- Interface adapts to show relevant actions only

### üöÄ Next Steps for Full Testing

1. **Create Test Admin User**
   ```bash
   # Use the create-admin API to create a system admin
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/create-admin \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "admin@test.com"}'
   ```

2. **Create Test Organization & Users** 
   - Admin creates organization via Better Auth
   - Admin invites organization members
   - Test organization member access

3. **Verify Permission Boundaries**
   - Admin should see all data
   - Org members should only see their organization data
   - API endpoints should enforce proper access control

4. **Test UI Adaptations**
   - Different buttons/actions for different roles
   - Role indicators (badges) display correctly  
   - Navigation adapts to user permissions

The implementation is complete and follows Better Auth 2025 best practices for shared admin/organization interfaces with proper data fetching patterns.
